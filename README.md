# SpotfireDockerScripts

## These scripts are now replaced by the [Cloud Deployment Kit for TIBCO Spotfire](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/spotfire-cloud-deployment-kit).  Please use the CDK recipes as they include Dockerfiles and helm charts for Kubernetes.  The Cloud Deployment Kit for TIBCO Spotfire works with Spotfire version 12.0 and above.  If you have to use containers, these scripts could be utilized for versions prior to Spotfire 12, but the recommendation is to upgrade to Spotfir 12.0 and use the CDK.

These directories include scripts for working with TIBCO Spotfire components in a Docker environment.  They are initial scripts tested within a non-enterprise environment.  

The scripts have been split into Spotfire7.11 and Spotfire10 directories.  The docker scripts in Spotfire7.11 should work with Spotfire 7.12 and earlier versions (they were tested with 7.11.3). The silent installation command changed in Spotfire 7.13 so the scripts in Spotfire10 should work with Spotfire 7.13 (they were tested with Spotfire 10.3.0).    In Spotfire Server 10.3, some of the directories where one finds the Spotfire scripts are different, thus the scripts for Spotfire 10.3 and Spotfire 10.2 also differ.  The Spotfire config.sh/config.bat command-line program is now in tomcat/spotfire-bin instead of tomcat/bin. 

The purpose of this information is to help one get started with using TIBCO Spotfire Server and TIBCO Spotfire Node Manager with Docker Containers.  The Docker and Spotfire Server software may change overtime.  The testing in this document was done with Spotfire version 7.11 and 10 and Docker engine version 18.09.2 on Windows.  The Spotfire install scripts likely will not change much between versions, but one should be aware of this possibility.

Please see the TIBCO Community article for more information - [TIBCO Spotfire Server Docker Scripts](https://community.tibco.com/wiki/tibco-spotfirer-server-docker-scripts)

**NOTE: Any executable files, rpm files, and sdn (Spotfire deployment files) MUST be obtained from the TIBCO Software download site and are not provided as part of the GitHub files.**  For example, the Dockerfile for Spotifre Server for Windows references the setup-win64.exe, the Spotfire.Dxp.sdn and the tss_simpleconfig.txt file which are not in the directory downloaded from GitHub.  The setup-win64.exe file comes from the TIB_sfire_server_<version>_win.zip file available from the TIBCO Software download site.  The Spotfire.Dxp.sdn file is part of the TIB_sfire_deploy_<version>.zip file.  The tss_simpleconfig.txt file is part of the GitHub scripts but is in the SpotfireServerConfig directory.  Please see the referenced TIBCO Community article for more information.
